Week 2

Last Week:

Formed group
Brainstormed ideas, chose accelerometer
Began designing and looking for parts

Next Week:

Continue designing product
Order parts

Issues:

We need still need to figure out what our requirements are so that we can choose the best parts to develop our product.


Week 3

Last Week:

Put together more detailed design of project, including list of parts as well as the tasks we will have.

Next Week:

Order parts
Attend the PSU EPL workshop

Issues:

We still need to learn more Arduino code and receive parts.


Week 4

Last Week:

Decided to use LED ring as accelerometer display
Planned schematic
Ordered parts
Attended PSU EPL workshop weekend, where group members learned basics to Arduino and EagleCAD

Next Week:

Receive parts
Begin prototyping; writing code, assembling circuit


Issues:

Need to learn more Arduino code

Week 5

Last Week:

Received Parts
Began building prototype

Next Week:

Continue building prototype
Begin writing code
Layout PCB
Create project schedule

Issues:

Need to learn more Arduino code
Laying out PCB with EagleCAD
Figure out what size of components we are using so that we can lay out the PCB

Week 6

Last Week:

Made Schedule
Received Parts
Continued building prototype and started writing code
Laid out PCB

Next Week:

Continue coding and testing prototype
Order PCB and enclosure
Create BOM

Issues:

Need to have a good idea of the size of the final product so that we can order an enclosure
Need to complete designs so that we can write our BOM

Week 7

Last Week:

Coding
Order PCB and enclosure 
Create BOM

Next Week:

Finsih BOM
Finish LED code
Write LED test code
test LEDs
Work on accelerometer code

Issues:

Had to choose SPI for Arduino code; SPI more suitable for our application.
Need to continue figuring out Arduino code.
