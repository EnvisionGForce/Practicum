Week 2

Last Week:

Formed group
Brainstormed ideas, chose accelerometer
Began designing and looking for parts

Next Week:

Continue designing product
Order parts

Issues:

We need still need to figure out what our requirements are so that we can choose the best parts to develop our product.


Week 3

Last Week:

Put together more detailed design of project, including list of parts as well as the tasks we will have.

Next Week:

Order parts
Attend the PSU EPL workshop

Issues:

We still need to learn more Arduino code and receive parts.


Week 4

Last Week:

Decided to use LED ring as accelerometer display
Planned schematic
Ordered parts
Attended PSU EPL workshop weekend, where group members learned basics to Arduino and EagleCAD

Next Week:
